# **GPTree User Manual**

## **1. Overview**
GPTree is a web-based learning platform that helps users explore and understand any topic using
AI-powered learning trees.
Each topic begins with a single "root" node, than can branch into follow-up/deeper subtopics.

GPTree turns AI conversations into structured, navigable learning tees. Each node can automatically
generate flashcards for review of topics/nodes, and users can revisit them later using spaced
repetition for better long-term memory.

### **WHY USE GPTree?**
    - Build a personal knowledge tree for any subject, with clearly connected ideas
    - Ask questions natuallu and see how different concepts relate
    - Turn any learning session into flashcards and review then efficiently
    - Organize your learning, no longer getting unstructered notes


## **2. Running GPTree**
a. Open browser with https://gptree-one.vercel.app/ 
b. Either sign in with you email or continue with Google


## **3. Using GPTree**
a. Create an account: 
    Add your email into the text box or signing in with Google
    Once logged in, you'll see the listing all of your trees and a prompt to create a new tree

b. Create a Tree
    Enter a topic into the prompt box
    GPTree will generate a root node explaining the topic
    The Tree will display the root node which you could click to go back to if at any time you
    Create a child node

c. Creating new nodes
    Click any node in your tree to open it
    There you will see the original question and response, key points, and suggested follow-up
    questions
    Click a follow-up to create a new node branching off the current node, or manually write a new
    question to go into a sub topic

d. Review and Navigate trees
    Use the Tree view page to see your learning structure and the conversation within that tree
    Click any node to read its contents or add new questions
    Use the side panel to switch between different trees

e. Going through Flashcards
    In the flashcard page, select which topics you would like to review
    GPTree will automatically create cards based off the content in the tree topics
    With the cards you can go through concepts and ideas, rating the difficulty as you go along

f. Using Spaced Repetition
    Go to Study Page to review all topics where GPTree will show flashcards of all the 
    trees the user have created
    GPTree will automatically generate the order of which to review the flashcards based off the
    difficutly in which you chose the flashcards as you reviewed them


## 4. Reporting bugs**
If you run into an issue, report it in the Issue Tracker https://github.com/Britwad/GPTree/Issues

Filing a good Bug Report:

### **4.1. Describe the problem**
    What you expected to happen?
    What actually happened?

### 4.2. Include reproduction steps**
    What steps you took leading up to the issue?

### **4.3. Attach relevent details**
    Screenshots (User Interfact bug)
    Error messages or console logs
    
## **5. Current limitations**
    Flashcard generation may occationally repeat or omit key concepts
    Tree visualization may slow for very large trees
