## Richman Pham

**i. Last week’s goals**
- None,  no goals were set last week.

**ii. Progress and issues**

- Progress
  - Cloned the project repository and set it up locally in VS Code.
  - Initialized Prisma for the project (created Prisma project/files and connected it to the codebase).
  - Created a status report file following the repo’s `reports/YYYYMMDD.md` convention.
  - Collaborated with the team on the second assignment (pair session to align on requirements and approach).

- Issues
  - Unable to run the development server, consistent “500 Internal Server Error”.
    - Suspected causes: incomplete Prisma setup (missing account/DB connection/config) and/or local environment differences on macOS.
    - Error persists after basic restart attempts; needs targeted debugging (see plans).

**iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)**
- Restore working `dev` environment by Tue, Oct 14
  - Verify Prisma config and DB connectivity (approximately 1.5–2 hrs)
  - Inspect server logs/stack traces; add temporary error logging to pinpoint failing route or DB call  (1–2 hrs)
  - Validate Node/npm versions and reinstall deps; clear cache and rebuild  (0.5–1 hr)
  - Definition of done: `npm run dev` starts without 500 errors; one test page performs a successful DB read.

- Fix root cause of the 500 error (follow-ups if needed) 
  - Implement concrete fix (schema/migration/env variable or handler logic) (1–2 hrs)
  - Re-test end-to-end and document the fix in `docs/dev-setup.md` (0.5–1 hr)

- Complete the Architecture Assignment (due Tue, Oct 14 @ 11:59 pm PT)

- UI ideation with Yana (target: end of week 4/beginning of week 5)
  - 45–60 min whiteboard session to outline key user flows and 2–3 primary screens
  - Convert sketches to low-fidelity wireframes for the agreed screens
  - Capture open questions and acceptance criteria for each screen
