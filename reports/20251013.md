Format
Each status report must be a markdown file and must include the following two sections:

1. Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting).

2. Contributions of individual team members.

Both sections should have the following three subsections. Each subsection is best organized as bullet points.

i. Last week’s goals: an exact copy of the third section from last week (i.e., goals from a week ago). It is empty for the first week.

ii. Progress and issues: what you did, what worked, what you learned, where you had trouble, and where you are stuck.

iii. Plans and goals for the next week: each bullet point should include a measurable task and a time estimate.

- You may use nested bullet points for parts of a larger task.

- If tasks from one week ago aren’t yet complete, they should roll over into tasks for the next week, with a brief statement about struggles or blockers, and an updated estimate for time to completion.

- For individual team members, no bottom-level time estimate should be greater than 3 days. If a task would be larger, think about a logical way to break it down and to have insight into progress.

- For the team report, this subsection should be higher-level and indicate who is responsible for what tasks. Also, it’s good to include longer-term goals in this list as well, to keep the bigger picture in mind and plan beyond just the next week.

<b>Team Report</b>

i. Last week's goals
  - N\A

ii. Progress and issues
  - Progress
    - Dev server has been set up and successfully connected to Prisma
    - Communcication policies within the team have been further specified going forward
    - Everyone on the team has been able to clone into the GitHub repo
  - Issues
    - There was an issue with the dev environment on MacOS which was caused by a second app directory being generated for Prisma, which has been resolved
    - There is currently a 500 status code issue with the dev environent that is also related to Prisma, we are unsure of the cause but will look into it this week (See plans in Richman and Jackson's sections)

iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
  - UI/UX (Richman and Yana)
    - something
  - Frontend (Richman, Yana, Brittan)
    - something else
    - Work with backend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment
  - Backend (Jackson, Jungho, Brittan)
    - Primary focus is to begin working with the Groq API so that we can start generating and handling responses
    - Work with frontend team to resolve the 500 status code bug when trying to run the dev environment

<b>Richman Pham</b>

i. Last week’s goals
- None,  no goals were set last week.

ii. Progress and issues 

- Progress
  - Cloned the project repository and set it up locally in VS Code.
  - Initialized Prisma for the project (created Prisma project/files and connected it to the codebase).
  - Created a status report file following the repo’s `reports/YYYYMMDD.md` convention.
  - Collaborated with the team on the second assignment (pair session to align on requirements and approach).

- Issues
  - Unable to run the development server, consistent “500 Internal Server Error”.
    - Suspected causes: incomplete Prisma setup (missing account/DB connection/config) and/or local environment differences on macOS.
    - Error persists after basic restart attempts; needs targeted debugging (see plans).

iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
- Restore working `dev` environment by Tue, Oct 14
  - Verify Prisma config and DB connectivity (approximately 1.5–2 hrs)
  - Inspect server logs/stack traces; add temporary error logging to pinpoint failing route or DB call  (1–2 hrs)
  - Validate Node/npm versions and reinstall deps; clear cache and rebuild  (0.5–1 hr)
  - Definition of done: `npm run dev` starts without 500 errors; one test page performs a successful DB read.

- Fix root cause of the 500 error (follow-ups if needed) 
  - Implement concrete fix (schema/migration/env variable or handler logic) (1–2 hrs)
  - Re-test end-to-end and document the fix in `docs/dev-setup.md` (0.5–1 hr)

- Complete the Architecture Assignment (due Tue, Oct 14 @ 11:59 pm PT)

- UI ideation with Yana (target: end of week 4/beginning of week 5)
  - 45–60 min whiteboard session to outline key user flows and 2–3 primary screens
  - Convert sketches to low-fidelity wireframes for the agreed screens
  - Capture open questions and acceptance criteria for each screen
