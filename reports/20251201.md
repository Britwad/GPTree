# Team Report

## i. Last week's goals
   - Gamma release on tuesday, record video (1 hr)
  - Let users create studySets (2 hrs)
  - Fix streaming (1 hr)
## ii. Progress and issues
- Progress:
  - Fixed streaming issue for new conversationPanel
  - Added "auto-select" for when you initially click on a tree
  - Added arrow key support for navigating tree!
  - Reviewed pull request for spaced-repetition feature, gave feedback
  - Added new button for spaced-repetition page
  - Added support for clarificaiton feature! Now node is replaced after a clarifiation is given.
  - Added re-generate node button.
- Issues
  - The spaced-repetition page currently is not used as a studyset. This should be refactored so that the same flashcard viewer can be used for the spaced repetition page and for reviewing flashcards.
  - We may want to add support for OpenAI's api so that we can demo and/or test higher quality models.
## iii. Plans and goals for the next week (measurable tasks with time estimates)
- Let users create studysets on /flashcards page (2 hrs)
- Improve look of spaced repetition feed and make major quality of life improvements (2 hrs)
- Add conversation context (1-2 hrs)
